# Stanford CS 124 Final Project - ChatBot

This project implements a "ChatBot" which reads in inputs from a user regarding their like/dislike for movies, and uses these sentiments to output movie recommendations. The ChatBot has two modes: creative and normal. Normal mode operates according to the description above, where creative mode aims at giving the bot a sense of identity and improvement in ability to further interpret and respond to a wider array of inputs. The addition of features in creative mode are outlined below.
