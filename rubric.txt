Dorian: I worked primarily on the functions for extracting movie titles from user's input
and finding corresponding titles in the database. I also completed the binarize function,
all of the functionality for recommend (collaborative filtering), disambiguate, and 
spell-checking through Levenshtein distance. Additionally, I handled much of the logic for
how these functions are utilized in the process function for communicating with the user. I 
handled spellchecking  for the user's input as well as helping the user clarify any inputs
that are ambiguous that return multiple possible movie titles.   

Monique:
She honestly didn't put much effort into this assignment at all. She was willing to meet
Together when we first started working on the assignment but after that, she didn't show
up to any further meetings that we planned out days in advance. She only helped in creating
Arbitrary string responses for what our chatbot says when talking with the user but that's it.
She honestly didn't really do anything.
